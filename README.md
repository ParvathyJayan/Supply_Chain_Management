# Supply_Chain_Management
## Overview:
In response to challenges faced by a Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) company in managing their instant noodles business, this project aims to build a model using historical data to determine the optimum weight of the product to be shipped from each warehouse. Over the past two years, the company's higher management has observed a significant mismatch between demand and supply, leading to inventory cost losses and overall financial impacts. The project focuses on optimizing the supply quantity in each warehouse across the entire country.
## Objectives:
1.Optimization Goal: Determine the optimal weight of product shipments to minimize inventory costs and enhance overall supply chain efficiency.

2.Data Science Approach: Employ a comprehensive data science approach, including Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data processing, model building, evaluation, and visualization.

3.Key Metrics: Utilize crucial attributes such as warehouse details, geographical factors, and historical performance metrics to make informed decisions.
## Data Science Steps:
• Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Uncover hidden patterns, trends, and insights within the data to gain a deeper understanding of the supply chain dynamics.

• Data Processing: Cleanse and preprocess the dataset to ensure accurate and reliable input for model training.

• Model Building: Implement supervised regression algorithms, including linear regression, decision tree, random forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Machine, to predict optimal shipment weights.

• Evaluation: Assess the performance of each model using relevant metrics to identify the most effective solution.

• Visualization: Present findings through visualizations to facilitate better decision-making and understanding of the supply chain.
## Machine Learning Algorithms:
Here, we employ various supervised regression algorithms to address the optimization challenge: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest,Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Machine.
