# Supply_Chain_Management
## Overview:
In response to challenges faced by a Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) company in managing their instant noodles business, this project aims to build a model using historical data to determine the optimum weight of the product to be shipped from each warehouse. Over the past two years, the company's higher management has observed a significant mismatch between demand and supply, leading to inventory cost losses and overall financial impacts. The project focuses on optimizing the supply quantity in each warehouse across the entire country.
## Objectives:
1.Optimization Goal: Determine the optimal weight of product shipments to minimize inventory costs and enhance overall supply chain efficiency.
2.Data Science Approach: Employ a comprehensive data science approach, including Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data processing, model building, evaluation, and visualization.
3.Key Metrics: Utilize crucial attributes such as warehouse details, geographical factors, and historical performance metrics to make informed decisions.
